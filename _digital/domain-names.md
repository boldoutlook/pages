In today’s digital age, the domain name system is a cornerstone of the internet, enabling users to navigate the vast expanse of online content with ease. With a diverse array of top-level domains (TLDs) available, the selection of a domain extension can significantly impact a website’s identity, accessibility, and relevance. From traditional domains like .com and .net to specialized ones such as .tech and .ai, each TLD serves unique purposes and comes with its own set of rules and characteristics.

This comprehensive table offers a detailed overview of various top-level domains, categorizing them into generic, country code, sponsored, and new gTLDs. It covers essential aspects such as type, description, character length requirements, registration policies, and additional features like DNSSEC and IDN support. Whether you're a business seeking a memorable web address, a developer looking for a tech-focused domain, or an individual interested in a personal website, this guide provides valuable insights into the world of domain names, helping you make informed decisions for your online presence.
